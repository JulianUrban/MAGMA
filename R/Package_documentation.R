#' MAGMA: A package for MAny Group MAtching
#'
#' This package enables nearest neighbor matching for two to four groups. It is
#' also possible to match for a 2x2 Design. Besides the matching functions, this
#' package include a function to compute balance criteria. These are
#' *Pillai's Trace*, *d-ratio*, *mean g*, and *adjusted d-ratio*. Moreover, one
#' function enables the representation of these balance criteria in an APA
#' table. Lastly, one function creates plots to show the balance trend for
#' different matching scenarios.
