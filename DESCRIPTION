Description: Balancing quasi-experimental field research for effects of covariates is fundamental for drawing causal inference. Propensity Score Matching deals with this issue but current techniques are restricted to binary treatment variables. Moreover, they provide several solutions without providing a comprehensive framework on choosing the best model. The MAGMA-package addresses these restrictions by offering nearest neighbor matching for two to four groups. It also includes the option to match data of a 2x2 design. In addition, MAGMA includes a framework for evaluating the post-matching balance. Thee package includes function for the matching process and matching reporting. We provide a tutorial on MAGMA as vignette.
